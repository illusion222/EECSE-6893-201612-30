# bigdata
Basically, our software is a python program. And the training data is “traindata.csv” ,the test data is “testdata.csv”. When you plan 
to run theprogram you have to put the two data files and the program file in the same directory. After running the program, there will
be a file called  “result.csv” produced. The result file would looks like:

The first number represent the user id and the five numbers behind represent the clusters recommended.
We also write a program to check the accuracy of the result. Similarly, you have to put it in the same 
directory with the data file when you run it.
